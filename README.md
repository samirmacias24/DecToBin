# DecToBin

**IDEA:**
This desktop application was created using Javafx. Its purpose is to take an integer value from the user and convert it to its equivalent binary value.
The program outputs "ERROR" when the value entered is too large (greater than 32-bit) or a string value is entered. Therefore, its only able to process both
positive and negative decimal values that aren't too large.
